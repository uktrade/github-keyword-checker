# Github keyword checker

This app will scan the commits in all public repos owned by an organisation and look for instances of keywords in those commits.  If keywords are found then an issue will be raised which requires the original committer to respond either indicating that the keyword checker found a false positive, or that they have taken remedial action to remove the prohibited keywords.

## Set up:

A github API key is required - see the bottom of settings.py for configuration options.
